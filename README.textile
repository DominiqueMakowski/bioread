h1. Libraries for reading BIOPAC files

These utilities are for reading the files produced by BIOPAC's AcqKnowledge software. Much of the information is based on  "Application Note 156":http://www.biopac.com/Manuals/app_pdf/app156.pdf from BIOPAC; however, the file format for 4.0 was determined through the tireless efforts of John Ollinger.

Note: This package does not (yet) work with compressed files. Then again, neither does BIOPAC's file API. So there.

This library is mostly concerned with getting you the data, and less so with interpreting all of the UI-related header values.

h2. Usage (Draft. May change hugely.)

bc.
>>> from bioread.readers import AcqReader
>>> bpdata = AcqReader.read("myfile.acq")
>>> bpdata.file_version
44
>>> len(bdata.channels)
2
>>> len(bdata.channels[0].data)
10002
>>> len(bdata.channels[1].data) # This channel is sampled at half the rate
5001
>>> bdata.channels[0].name
CO2
>>> bdata.channels[0].data[0]
1.23
>>> from bioread.writers import MatlabWriter
>>> MatlabWriter.write("myfile.mat", bpdata) # Does "something sane"

h1. Libraries for reading BIOPAC files

These utilities are for reading the files produced by BIOPAC's AcqKnowledge software. Much of the information is based on  "Application Note 156":http://www.biopac.com/Manuals/app_pdf/app156.pdf from BIOPAC; however, the file format for 4.0 was determined through the tireless efforts of John Ollinger.

Note: This package does not (yet) work with compressed files. Then again, neither does BIOPAC's file API. So there.

This library is mostly concerned with getting you the data, and less so with interpreting all of the UI-related header values.

h2. Usage (Draft. May change hugely.)

<pre>
>>> from bioread.readers import AcqReader
>>> bpdata = AcqReader.read("myfile.acq")
>>> bpdata.file_revision
44
>>> len(bdata.channels)
2
>>> bdata.channels[0].samples_per_second
1000
>>> len(bdata.channels[0].data)
10002
>>> bdata.channels[1].samples_per_second
500
>>> len(bdata.channels[1].data) 
5001
>>> len(bdata.channels[1].upsampled_data)
10002
>>> bdata.channels[0].data[0]
1.23
>>> bdata.channels[0].raw_data[0] # ints are not scaled
13
>>> bdata.channels[0].name
'CO2'
>>> bdata.named_channels['CO2'].data[0]
1.23
>>> from bioread.writers import MatlabWriter
>>> MatlabWriter.write("myfile.mat", bpdata) # Does "something sane"
</pre>

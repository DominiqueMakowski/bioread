h1. Libraries for reading BIOPAC files

These utilities are for reading the files produced by BIOPAC's AcqKnowledge software. Much of the information is based on  "Application Note 156":http://www.biopac.com/Manuals/app_pdf/app156.pdf from BIOPAC; however, newer file formats were decoded through the tireless efforts of John Ollinger and Nate Vack.

This library is mostly concerned with getting you the data, and less so with interpreting UI-related header values.

h2. Command-line usage:

There's one command-line utility so far: acq_to_mat. It creates a Matlab (version 5) file from an AcqKnowledge file. In the back-end, it uses "scipy.io.savemat":http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.io.savemat.html. Channels are named "n1" through "nN"

<pre>
acq_to_mat myfile.acq myfile.mat
</pre>

h2. API usage:

If you want to process the data as NumPy arrays instead, there's an easy API to work with it:

<pre>
>>> from bioread.readers import AcqReader
>>> data = AcqReader.read_file("myfile.acq")
>>> data.file_revision
44
>>> len(data.channels)
2
>>> data.channels[0].samples_per_second
1000.0
>>> len(data.channels[0].data)
10002
>>> data.channels[1].samples_per_second
500.0
>>> len(data.channels[1].data) 
5001
>>> len(data.channels[1].upsampled_data)
10002
>>> data.channels[0].data[0]
1.23
>>> data.channels[0].raw_data[0] # ints are not scaled
13
>>> data.channels[0].name
'CO2'
>>> data.named_channels['CO2'].data[0]
1.23
>>> from bioread.writers import MatlabWriter
>>> MatlabWriter.write_file(data, "myfile.mat") # Creates a matlab file.
</pre>

h2. TODO:

* This package does not (yet) work with compressed files. Then again, neither does BIOPAC's file API. So there.
* Channel order in the AcqKnowledge interface is different than we get here. There seems to be something more at play than nChanOrder, but I don't know what.
